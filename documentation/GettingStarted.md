# Getting started
This documentation aims to get you started with XenForo 2.0 development. Pre-requisites for this documentation assume you will be familiar with, amongst other things, PHP and MySQL. It is not essential to have experience with a previous version of XenForo, but it would be an advantage.

On the subsequent pages we will walk you through a brief overview of how to setup a local server, getting ready for installation, doing a clean install of XenForo 2.0, and run through some of the concepts of XF2 development.
